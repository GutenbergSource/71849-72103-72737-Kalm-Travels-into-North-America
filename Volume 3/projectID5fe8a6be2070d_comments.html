<HTML><BODY>This travelogue of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pehr_Kalm">Pehr Kalm</a> originally appeared in Sweden in 1753–1761 as <i>En Resa til Norra America</i>. It was later translated into German, and from German into English, and first appeared in 1770-1771. It is an important historical document on the former English colonies in North America, and although is interest was mostly botany (to find species that could be useful in Sweden), he also describes the society and nature of the places he visited.

<p>The printing is typical for 18th century books. It uses the ſ for s at the start of a syllable. The OCR has often turned this into an f (and the preprocessor into an *), and we need to change this to the normal s.

</p><p>The catchwords (repeating the first word of a page at the bottom of the previous page) can be removed. The repeated opening quotes at the beginning of each line should also be removed (only the very first opening quote of a citation and the last should remain, as well as those at the beginning of a new paragraph, if a citation happens to spread over multiple paragraphs.)

</p><p>The first word of every paragraph is set in small caps. This need not be indicated (during formatting).

</p><p>For the rest, it is not a too complicated text, so have fun!
